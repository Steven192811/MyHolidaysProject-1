# My Holidays at the Dominican Republic 

My Holidays at the Dominican Republic is a website where I shared part of my recent holidays in the Dominican Republic and some history about the country. 
The purpose with the website is to target different users who are interested in learning more about the country and things they could do.


### Existing features
#### Navigation bar 
* Users will find a navigation bar on the website, the navigation bar includes links to the main places I went. Each place visited includes a photo and a map related to the area.
#### Form
* The Form is located on the navigation bar and when clicked, it will open in a new tab so the user can share their information and provide feedback.
#### Footer 
* This section includes links to Facebook and to Instagram. The links will open up in a new tab to make it easier for the user.


#### Share Your Interest form
* This form allows the user to enter their details, choose cities they would like to visit and when they would like to go.

### Features left to carry out
#### Videos from the cities
* The user would be able to see a video that plays automatically without a sound but having the option to activate the sound. 

### Validation testing 
#### HTML 
* 40 errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/) but it doesnÂ´t make any sense. It says that I'm not supposed to use % (example: width: 100%;) which I don't understand the reason for those errors if the website works perfectly according to my knowledge.
#### CSS 
* No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) 

### Unfixed bugs 
* The content of the header are not responsive enough when viewed from a small screen.
*The padding from the paragraphs next to the city images are not functioning the way I would like them to do since I would like to keep some space between the images and the texts but it ends up too close. 
* Form is not fully centered on the screen, it's a bit off to the right side.
### fixed bugs
* Fully responsive header.
* Padding was successfully added to the texts besides the images.

### Deployment 
* The site was deployed to the GitHub website. The steps to deploy are as follows:
- In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
- From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
- Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to show the successful deployment.
