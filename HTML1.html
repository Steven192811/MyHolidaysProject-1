          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santo_Domingo" alt="Santo Domingo (link opens in a new tab)" target="_blank"> Santo Domingo</a> is the capital and largest city of the Dominican Republic and the largest metropolitan area in the Caribbean by population. The city is rich in history and there are plenty of things to do as well. I was born and lived here until I was 15 years of age.
        </p>

        <p>
          In Santo Domingo, I visited many of my family members and hanged out with many of my friends and relatives. I went to a few places in the city and to name a few would be <a href="https://www.visitdominicanrepublic.org/zona-colonial-santo-domingo" alt="Zona Colonial (link opens in a new tab)" target="_blank"> Zona Colonial</a> and <a href="https://www.visitarepublicadominicana.org/jardin-botanico-santo-domingo" alt="Jardin Botanico (link opens in a new tab)" target="_blank"> Jarding Botanico</a>. </p>

        <p>Santo Domingo (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈsanto ðoˈmiŋɡo] meaning "Saint Dominic"), once known as Santo Domingo de Guzmán and Ciudad Trujillo, is the capital and largest city of the Dominican Republic and the largest metropolitan area in the Caribbean by population. As of 2010, the city had a total population of 2,908,607, when including the metropolitan area. The city is coterminous with the boundaries of the Distrito Nacional, itself bordered on three sides by Santo Domingo Province.
        <p>
          Founded by the Spanish in 1496, on the east bank of the Ozama River and then moved by Nicolás de Ovando in 1502 to the west bank of the river, the city is the oldest continuously inhabited European settlement in the Americas, and was the first seat of the Spanish colonial rule in the New World, the Captaincy General of Santo Domingo. The city's Colonial Zone was declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Santo Domingo was called Ciudad Trujillo from 1936 to 1961, after the Dominican Republic's dictator, Rafael Trujillo, named the capital after himself. Following his assassination, the city resumed its original designation.
        </p>
<p>
        Santo Domingo is the cultural, financial, political, commercial and industrial center of the Dominican Republic, with the vast majority of the country's most important industries being located within the city. Santo Domingo also serves as the chief seaport of the country. The city's harbor at the mouth of the Ozama River accommodates the largest vessels, and the port handles both heavy passenger and freight traffic. Temperatures are high year round, with cooler breezes during winter time.

      <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_de_los_Caballeros" alt="Santiago (link opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">Santiago</a> in my personal opinion is better than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santo_Domingo" alt="Santo Domingo (link opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">Santo Domingo</a> due to many factors, such as the cleaninless of the city is much better, there are less traffic jams, food and many other things are cheaper as well.</p>

      <p>The boss of my sister's boyfriend invited them, another couple and myself to visit Santiago where he is originally from and we went to stay at his parent's place. It's a huge house with around 6 rooms and 3 floors including an underground floor. His parents used to live in the USA for over 30 years and little by little they were building their dream house in their country.</p>

      <p>We visited one of the most famous places in Santiago which was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monumento_de_Santiago" alt="Monumento de Santiago (link opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">Monumento de Santiago</a> and the views were just lovely, you could see the whole city and the mountains from up there.</p>

      <p>
        Santiago de los Caballeros commonly known as simply Santiago, is the second-largest city in the Dominican Republic and the fourth-largest city in the Caribbean by population. It is the capital of Santiago Province and the largest major metropolis in the Cibao (northwestern) region of the country. The city has a total population of 1,173,015 inhabitants. Santiago is located approximately 155 km (96 mi) northwest of the capital Santo Domingo with an average altitude of 178 meters (584 ft).
      </p>
      <p>
        Founded in 1495 during the first wave of European settlement in the New World, the city is the "first Santiago of the Americas". Today it is one of the Dominican Republic's cultural, political, industrial and financial centers. Due to its location in the fertile Cibao Valley it has a robust agricultural sector and is a leading exporter of rum, textiles, and cigars Santiago is known as "La Ciudad Corazón" (the "Heartland City").

        Santiago de los Caballeros has historically been the capital of the country, and was an important strategic city in the Dominican War of Independence. The name of the city, Saint James of the Knights refers to the Hidalgos de la Isabela, a group of knights who had come from La Isabela city to stay in Santiago. Sometimes the city is called Santiago de los 30 Caballeros (English: Saint James of the 30 Knights).

      <p>We Decided to go to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarabacoa" alt="Jarabacoa (link opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">Jarabacoa</a> after going to Santiago. We visited the <a href="https://www.visitdominicanrepublic.org/salto-de-jimenoa-waterfall-jarabacoa" alt="Salto de Jimenoa (link opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">Salto de Jimenoa</a> which has a unique way of getting there. We had to decent through a very steep path and the sixth of us were having difficulties getting down there, each one of us fell at some point during the hike but it was a unique experience and it was worth it in the end.</p>
      <p>
        Jarabacoa is a town and the second largest municipality in La Vega Province, Dominican Republic. The natives of the island inhabited the valley of Jarabacoa. It is assumed that the city's name was formed out of the words 'Jaraba' and 'Coa', meaning "Land of Waters" in the native language. Some say that the Spanish conquistadors actually made it to Jarabacoa in their search for gold, but later abandoned the expedition. Some reasons include, resistance by the natives or as some say, because no large finds were ever made, although to this day gold can be washed from some of the many rivers.</p>
      <p>
        Jarabacoa most likely belonged to the Chiefdom of Maguana making it part of the kingdom of Cibao. Necessary archaeological work has yet to take place, but it can be assumed that the natives lived in the area long before the arrival of Christopher Columbus.[6] It wasn't until 1805 that the area began being re-populated, during the Haitian invasion of the Cibao, when survivors from the massacres of Santiago de los Caballeros and La Vega escaped to the mountains of the Central Range and settled in the valley of Jarabacoa. In 1854, a military post was established and the town was formally founded. On September 27, 1858 the town was incorporated as a municipality.</p>

        I was mostly spending time and chatting with my family members rather than going out since it has been a while that we got to see each other.
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dajab%C3%B3n" alt="Dajabon (link opens in a new tab)" target="_blank">Dajabon</a> is a small province in the Dominican Republic with a small population. People there mostly go out for a drink and to hang out at the rivers where they also bring food, drinks and music. People there have a lot of freedom to do many things and life there is calm.
      </p>

      <p>
        Dajabón is a municipality and capital of the Dajabón province in the Dominican Republic. Located on the northwestern border with Haiti. It is a market town with a population of about 26,000, north of the Cordillera Central mountain range.

        Dajabón is located on the Dajabón River, also known as the Massacre River, due to an incident that took place in 1728, in which 30 French Buccaneers were killed by Spanish settlers.The name also became popular after being the site of killings during the Parsley Massacre, though the event was not the origin of its name.
      </p>
      <p>
        The city was initially founded between 1771 and 1776, but was soon after abandoned during the War of Independence. It was settled again shortly after the Restoration War in 1865. During the 1822–44 Haitian occupation, the city was officially designated in French as Dahabon.

        A battle took place at the city between the Spanish and the French in the 17th century. At the time of the battle, the governor of the French colony, Mr. Cussy, was killed in the Battle of the Sabana Real de la Limonada, near modern-day Limonade in northern Haiti.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dajabón is the checking point for everyone who wants to cross the Haitian border. It was the Independence Battle’s setting. The Dominicans held the city against their neighbouring country in the mid 19th century: this war left a mark on the Dominicans, who erected commemorative monuments in honour of the public figures that fought in the consecutive battles.

        It’s economy is mainly based on farming, ranching, and rice, milk, and meat trade with Haiti.

        It was founded by Toussaint L’Ouverture and it is named after the Taíno word Dahaboon.

        You can enjoy its culture and traditions from the very moment you arrive at the town. You can walk from its Triumphal Arch, dated from Rafael Trujillo’s era, to the multitudinous Bi-National Market where it is possible to buy almost every kind of products and you will find the largest Haitian and Dominican cultural mix.</p>
      <p>
        You can learn its most recent history through the photographs that are on display at the Images from the Border Museum, and discover their most patriotic feelings through the monuments Heroes of Sabana Larga and Heroes of Beller.

        Enjoy the gifts of nature at Sabana Clara Ecological Camp, El Salto Spa, Chacuey’s Wildlife Shelter, or explore the magnificent Nalga de Maco National Park and its incredible cave.
